{% include base_path %}

My name is **Kevin Hinterlong**, I'm a **Math & CS** major at the **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**.

While I'm interested in both Math _and_ Computer Science, I'm more interested in Computer Science, especially for independent work.

I've primarily worked with 
- Java (+Android)
- JavaScript (React Native)

{% capture notice-1 %}
However I've also used C, C++, and Python.

And recently I've been teaching myself Rust and Go.

I have also worked on Open Source projects (see [GitHub Repos](https://github.com/kevinhinterlong?tab=repositories))
