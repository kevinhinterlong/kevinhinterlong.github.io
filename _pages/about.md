All about me.

## Basic Info

I'm a Math & CS major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. While I'm interested in both, my primary interest is Computer Science.

I've slowly worked on this website for a while now as a way to show projects I've worked on and things I'm interested in.

The majority of my work has been in Java (+Android) however I've used C/C++/Python as well and have been teaching myself Rust.
