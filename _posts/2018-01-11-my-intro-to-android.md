## Where I started

I started Android Development in my Senior year of high school. At first, it was challenging - learning a new framework, a new IDE, designing a GUI. It was a big jump from only developing small CLI applications in Java. 

As the semester went on, I realized that the development process was very friendly and fairly easy to adjust to the structure of Android Development. Eventually I started branching out into more difficult areas of Android, exploring new things like game development with OpenGL.

## Where I am

Currently I have several apps in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store).

- [Paddle Ball](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hinterlong.kevin.paddleball) - A simple game in OpenGL
- [Movie Listing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hinterlong.kevin.movielisting) - A simple way to search for and save details to your phone (I think the API for this is now down unfortunately).
- [ArchWiki Viewer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jtmcn.archwiki.viewer) - An application I inherited for viewing the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)
- [HackIllinois 2017](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hackillinois.branding) - The official HackIllinois app for 2017 (not owned by me).

**Note:** Several of these apps are open source and you can check them out on [my GitHub](https://github.com/kevinhinterlong).
